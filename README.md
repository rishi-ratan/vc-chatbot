## Getting Started
### Prerequisites

#### To Run Locally
- [Azure Developer CLI](https://aka.ms/azure-dev/install)
- [Python 3+](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
    - **Important**: Python and the pip package manager must be in the path in Windows for the setup scripts to work.
    - **Important**: Ensure you can run `python --version` from console. On Ubuntu, you might need to run `sudo apt install python-is-python3` to link `python` to `python3`.    
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
- [Powershell 7+ (pwsh)](https://github.com/powershell/powershell) - For Windows users only.
   - **Important**: Ensure you can run `pwsh.exe` from a PowerShell command. If this fails, you likely need to upgrade PowerShell.

>NOTE: Your Azure Account must have `Microsoft.Authorization/roleAssignments/write` permissions, such as [User Access Administrator](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles#user-access-administrator) or [Owner](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles#owner).  

### Installation

#### Starting from scratch:

Execute the following command, if you don't have any pre-existing Azure services and want to start from a fresh deployment.

1. Run `azd up` - This will provision Azure resources and deploy this sample to those resources, including building the search index based on the files found in the `./data` folder.
1. After the application has been successfully deployed you will see a URL printed to the console.  Click that URL to interact with the application in your browser.  

It will look like the following:

> NOTE: It may take a minute for the application to be fully deployed. If you see a "Python Developer" welcome screen, then wait a minute and refresh the page.

#### Deploying or re-deploying a local clone of the repo:
* Simply run `azd up`

#### Running locally:
1. Run `azd login`
2. Change dir to `app`
3. Run `./start.ps1` or `./start.sh` or run the "VS Code Task: Start App" to start the project locally.
